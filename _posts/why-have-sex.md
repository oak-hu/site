# Why Have Sex?

<a href="/writing/" class="no-icon" style="font-size: 0.9rem; opacity: 0.7;">← Back to Writing</a>

## Introduction

A male organism is one with a reproductive function of fathering offspring.{% include sidenote.html content="Thus, an organism with both reproductive functions is both male and female." %} In the relevant sense, to father is to contribute a small gamete (a sperm).

$$RelativeFitness(y, x) = \frac{2x \cdot S(1.5x + 0.5y)}{(x + y) \cdot S(2x)}$$
