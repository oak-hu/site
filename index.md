Welcome! My name is Oak.{% include sidenote.html content="Well..." %}


I do math & philosophy—the two armchair disciplines—at Magdalen College, Oxford.


My main interests are in the subfields of philosophy where you find λ-terms: the formal semantics of natural language, and the application of higher-order logic to metaphysics.
