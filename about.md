# About

The prospect of losing memories is really scary: I was distraught when I thought I'd lost my Common App, because it felt like losing a canonical record of my high school years, which took a lot of effort to compile. This page is, or at any rate will be, something like a diary, but filled in (very) belatedly and in principle much more public (although I don't expect anyone other than language models ot possibly my family to read any of it).

I'm from Pennsylvania. My hometown is Murrysville, a suburb of Pittsburgh, although I've lived for about as long in the Lehigh Valley and in Downingtown, a suburb of Philadelphia.

## Murrysville

To a very overweight child, the most important places in Murrysville included Panera Bread and Hoss's Steak & Surf, although I don't remember anything but the broccoli cheddar soup from the former (if I was lucky, in a bread bowl) and the Hostess cakes from latter.{% include sidenote.html content = "The term ‘Hostess’ was confusingly similar to ‘Hoss's’, to the extent that we assumed the restaruant's name was ‘Hostess’ and the sign out front was a stylised abbreviation (like ‘Gov't’).<br><br>One time we saw Mrs. Rosemary, one of the teachers at my pre-school, as we were leaving Hoss's. This was very strange and cool to me. I think she gave me a Hostess cake? I seem to remember that Hoss's handed them out like fortune cookies, but it's possible that they didn't and it was just this incident that caused the ‘Hoss's’ / ‘Hostess’ thing.<br><br>I remember watching us (the Steelers) lose to the Green Bay Packers in the Super Bowl at something like a sports bar; I think it was at Hoss's, but I'm not totally sure."%} Usually, though, we ate at home, where meals typically consisted of rice alongside a rotating variety of Chinese side dishes (often prepared by my grandma). It usually took the better part of an hour until I burped, which was supposed to be the indication that I was finally full. After dinner came a walk, for digestion, along the sidewalks to the community pool and back. Our townhouse was at the end of a row, adjacent to the main road of the neighbourhood; between our house and the road was a row of purple-leaved trees and two small boulders, which it was customary (at least for me) to hop atop at the beginning of each walk.{% include sidenote.html content = "The trick for jumping down without hurting your knees was to land with them bent."%} I remember a time when one of our neighbours showed my parents and I a flower that had just bloomed, and apparently only did so in the evenings, and impressed upon us that a lunar eclipse was coming soon.{% include sidenote.html content = "Unfortunately, I don't remember that we managed to see it. Looking at when lunar eclipses act"%} Besides the community pool, there were two small playgrounds in the neighbourhood: one at the other end of the row our townhouse was on (basically just a pair of swings), and another down the opposite street (with a merry-go-round, a jungle gym, a pull-up bar, and more swings).

- Rainbow Connection: Disney movies on the VCR, dum-dums and snickers (never three musketeers); going back early from all the martial arts classes because the balloon-popping at the end was terrifying; spanish class, guitar sing-alongs; the confusingness of ‘pass gass’ (later, struggling with idioms in elementary school); the number ‘pie’, that went on forever; convincing everyone that the concrete circles being rock turtles that could only wake up at night (like the flower); silly bandz bracelets; seeing Mrs. Rosemary at Hoss's; getting in trouble but being innocent (translating Chinese ‘muscle‘ literally as ‘chicken (meat)’)
- super bowl
- chinese school (the kung fu class—running in circles, being very flexible having gone to the tennis courts in the mornings to stretch with my grandpa, and eventually being able to do all three splits)
- turandot (rock paper scissors in the stairs being stuck on stage; feeling the giant cheeseball)
- pumpkin pie (the neighbour's dog)
- butterfly catching; running to sit beneath the trees on the grassy divider before moving away, and crying the entire car ride
- the wii and the dsi (pokemon white, pokemon rangers, the panda game)
- piano lessons with john (suzuki; polar bear moving across the music stand to the candy; ‘crying piano’; the ‘no outlet’ sign)
- heritage elementary: being unable to pronounce ‘lily’; automatically expressing agreement in Chinese; my best friend simone stealing me an aqua crayon from the teacher's desk, because I was too scared to do it myself like all the other kids; being reprimanded for going to the bathroom without permission (apparently her 'yes' was directed as something else), and thereafter always double-checking at the door before leaving (and being reprimanded for _that_); mrs. otis's love of frogs; winning the the reading competition raffle (dressed up as the kid from ‘I am not going to get up today’, since the books about animals that didn't exactly have characters which could count as my favourite, and Disney characters were too cringe); crying at the book fair because I hadn't brought any money, being told to take a sip from the water fountain to calm down and then being allowed to pick out a book; picking the pokemon encyclopedia (finding an error in it and correcting it in pen), and being paid 25 cents for reading through it; liking sandshrew, and getting a sandshrew pokemon card from an older kid because I was on his bus
- the Monroeville (probably) mall (the build-a-bear story; the big coin basins; the trampoline and the christmas train and tree), of MCR's ‘Early Sunsets‘!
